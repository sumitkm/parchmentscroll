**Parchment Scroll** is simple Node JS application that uses *QuillJs* as a Rich
Text Editor wrapped in a KO Component. It is written entirely in TypeScript.

What does the 'Editor' do?
At this point it is simply a demo to save one file to Azure Blob Storage as a blockBlob object.

This started off as a playground for QuillJs and KO Components using NodeJS.
Might end up a complete blogging platform.

I have never done NodeJS before so that's just an additional challenge.
