* Parchment Scroll is sample Node JS application that uses *QuillJs* as a Rich
Text Editor wrapped in a KO component *

What does the 'Editor' do? Nothing at the moment, might save it off to a DB or
Azure blob store at some point.

In other words I have no idea what I am doing here! All I want is to play around
with QuillJs and KO Components using NodeJS.

I have never done NodeJS before so that's just an additional challenge.
